Installation instructions (CPAN package)
========================================

Installation procedure:

1) Uncompress the distribution archive (tar.gz);

2) Move in the directory created by the decompression ('ODF-lpOD-nnn', where
nnn is the version number);

3) Execute "perl Makefile.PL";

4) Execute "make test" (optional but recommended);

5) If nothing looks wrong, execute "make install" as system administrator from
the same directory.

The installation may be checked later using the "lpod_test" utility, that is
provided with the distribution. Without argument, this script just displays
the ODF::lpOD version, build date and installation path. If an arbitrary file
path/name is given as an argument, it generates a new test document (.odt)
that may be checked using any ODF-compatible text processor.
